# agriculture_robot
Fruit pick and place robot

# This package spawns a UR10 robot into a gazebo world and plots a circle trajectory

## Instructions to run the package

### Step 1
>git clone this package into your src folder 
>sudo apt install ros-galactic-ros2-control ros-galactic-ros2-controllers ros-galactic-gazebo-ros2-control
>sudo apt-get install ros-galactic-controller-manager

## Step 2
Extract the contents of models.zip 
run the following command for each folder inside the zip folder
> cp -r your_folder_name/ ~/.gazebo/models

### Step 3
>cd \<path to workspace root directory\>
>colcon build
Next time you can do the following
>colcon build --packages-select agriculture_robot

### Step 4
>source install/setup.bash

### Step 5
>ros2 launch agriculture_robot gazebo.launch.py

### Step 6
open a new terminal window source ros2, source workspace
>ros2 run agriculture_robot pick_and_place.py

### Troubleshooting
You will have to modify the path to the "live_data.csv" file before building the package in the agriculture_robot/src/pick_and_place.py file 

### Live Joint Update
After running the launch file and the ros2 node, and the robot has finished moving along the pre programmed trajectory, you can give it live joint angles by modifying the live_data.csv fine located in the /src folder. Another way to update this file is via the FK_test_script.py file located in the same directory.
